        text: 'Nine years ago, we at Stegreif started to unleash classical music. But as an organization, we are shackled by extreme financial pressure and uncertainty, especially in times of cutbacks in the cultural sector. In order to stand on stage with 30 people, we need considerable financial resources to pay all artists and staff fairly. The longing for depth that drives us in our work and fascinates our audience requires a structure that is not driven by short-term, constantly new projects.'

We want to achieve this amount through regular financial support from the Stegreif Family. The Stegreif Family is a community of Stegreif fans who want the orchestra to continue to exist and are willing to take responsibility through their financial contribution.'
