Four composition teams with different musical languages were commissioned to each arrange one movement for this work. The programme is not based on a single classical work, but contains references to different works by Gustav Mahler, which are, however, united by the common theme of nature. The result is a multifaceted reflection of Mahler's musical world with contemporary themes."

            quote: 'The varied evening liberates Mahler, showing the modern artistic potential of this composer, whose works are interpreted symphonically, but also get along with jazz and rock. Such stylistic surprises performed with this perfection are a characteristic of the young ensemble, which is composed of excellent musicians.'
