        text: "- from the traditional Concerto Grosso in G minor (Op. 6 No. 6, HWV 324: III) to the famous Rinaldo aria “Lascia ch'io pianga\" (HWV 7) and Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt (HWV 54). The result is a chamber music concert performance for 7 musicians with different artistic backgrounds, each with different approaches to baroque music and the art of improvisation. The performance is created on the spot by the musicians under the musical direction of Alistair Duncan, and is played by heart, freely moving in the performance space."
