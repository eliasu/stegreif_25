        text: "free∃roica is about revolutions - historical and musical - and the heroes they brought forth. The orchestra strives towards them\_without sheet music, without a conductor and without chairs, and in doing so also looks for the small disorders. For example;these disruptions \"only\" consist of entering the concert hall without shoes or taking the audience on a journey from 18th century France to the present. Thus, the Eroica is relieved with performance, improvisation and recomposition. Ripped pieces of sheet music, large majestic red cloth, destroyed orchestra positions of chairs and stands… All of these elements break the expectations of the listener to what Eroica was, and as part of the centuries-old canon repertoire, we find a new quest for this\_Beethoven’s new and bold work."
