We set a funding target for what we want to achieve together. Each member can then decide how much they would like to contribute and see what their own contribution represents in terms of the common goal. All members submit their contributions anonymously and we count them live to see whether we reach our funding target. If not, we repeat the whole thing 1-2 times and let Stegreif Musik surprise us. '
