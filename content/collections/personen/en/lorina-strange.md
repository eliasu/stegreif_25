description: "...juggles more virtuously with words and numbers than with notes and sounds. Her need to make art possible and to inspire people through music led her through musicology, dramaturgy and music education to Stegreif's management."
fun_fact: 'Discovered her musical passion playing double bass and still has a huge heart for the lower frequencies.'
