title: 'Anna Katharina Mei√üner'
description: "...came to Stegreif from the free economy, because without art the world is too dull for her. That's why she now wants to support artists and takes care of the orchestra's bookkeeping and finances. When she's not juggling numbers, the trained fashion designer works part-time on setting up her own business."
