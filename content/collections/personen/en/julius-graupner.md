description: 'Julius Graupner is currently studying Cultural and Media Management at Freie Universit√§t zu Berlin. Before Stegreif, he worked a lot and is still partly working as a freelancer in the "independent scene" as a production manager, social media manager and cultural worker for dance and performance projects. He is himself an artistically active dancer and choreographer and is currently also working on the development of the ganzkoerpern project, which will advance his physical practice and link it performatively with cultural-political themes and production work and, in the longer term, lead to the founding of a collective, for example.'
fun_fact: 'In a recurring nightmare, I am regularly asked for a "fun fact" about myself. I can never think of one'
