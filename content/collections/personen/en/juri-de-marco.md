description: '...had the idea on January 10, 2015 to found an orchestra where a few things run differently. After it became clear to him in May of the same year that it should be called "Stegreif", the foundation stone was laid. For him, Stegreif means not only improvisation and playing by heart, but also a constant exploration of new forms of leadership. Being the artistic director, while playing the horn in an ensemble rather than conducting it, led him to the realization that collective, effective and empathetic partaking in a group holds unexpectedly great potential.'
